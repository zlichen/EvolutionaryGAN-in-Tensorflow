# Reproduce E-GAN in TensorFlow
+ This repo is a modification of [bamos/dcgan-completion.tensorflow](https://github.com/bamos/dcgan-completion.tensorflow).
+ The code structure design goes to [carpedm20/DCGAN-tensorflow](https://github.com/carpedm20/DCGAN-tensorflow)
+ The EGAN model design (Theano Version) goes to [WANG-Chaoyue/EvolutionaryGAN](https://github.com/WANG-Chaoyue/EvolutionaryGAN).
+ This repository implements Wang, Chaoyue et al.'s paper's EGAN in Tensorflow.
